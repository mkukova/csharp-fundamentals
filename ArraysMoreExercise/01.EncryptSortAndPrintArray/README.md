1. 1.Encrypt, Sort and Print Array

Write a program that reads a **sequence of strings** from the console. Encrypt every string by summing:

- The code of **each vowel multiplied by the string length**
- The code of **each consonant divided by the string length**

**Sort** the **number** sequence in ascending order and print it on the console.

On first line, you will always receive the number of strings you have to read.

### Examples
