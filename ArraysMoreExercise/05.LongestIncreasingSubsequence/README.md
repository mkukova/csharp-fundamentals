1. 5.Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

Read a **list of integers** and find the **longest increasing subsequence** (LIS). If several such exist, print the **leftmost**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | 1 |
| 7 **3 5** 8 -1 0 **6 7** | 3 5 6 7 |
| **1 2** 5 **3 5** 2 4 1 | 1 2 3 5 |
| **0** 10 20 30 30 40 **1** 50 **2 3 4 5 6** | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 |
| 11 12 13 **3** 14 **4** 15 **5 6 7 8** 7 **16** 9 8 | 3 4 5 6 7 8 16 |
| **3** 14 **5** 12 15 **7 8 9 11** 10 1 | 3 5 7 8 9 11 |

### Hints

- Assume we have **n** numbers in an array **nums[0…n-1]**.
- Let **len[p]** holds the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) ending at position **p**.
- In a for loop, we shall calculate **len[p]** for **p** = **0** … **n-1** as follows:
  - Let **left** is the leftmost position on the left of **p** ( **left** \&lt; **p** ), such that **len[left]** is the largest possible.
  - Then, **len[p]** = **1** + **len[left]**. If **left** does not exist, **len[p]** = **1**.
  - Also, save **prev[p]** = **left** (we hold if **prev[]** the previous position, used to obtain the best length for position **p** ).
- Once the values for **len[0**…**n-1]** are calculated, restore the LIS starting from position **p** such that **len[p]** is maximal and go back and back through **p** = **prev[p]**.
- The table below illustrates these computations:

| index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| nums[] | **3** | **14** | **5** | **12** | **15** | **7** | **8** | **9** | **11** | **10** | **1** |
| len[] | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 1 |
| prev[] | -1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 7 | -1 |
| LIS | {3} | {3,14} | {3,5} | {3,5,12} | {3,5,12,15} | {3,5,7} | {3,5,7,8} | {3,5,7,8,9} | {3,5,7,8,9,11} | {3,5,7,8,9,10} | {1} |
