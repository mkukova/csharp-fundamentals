# 1.Lab: Strings and Text Processing

1. 1.Reverse Strings

You will be given series of strings until you receive an **&quot;end&quot;** command. Write a program that reverses strings and prints each pair on separate line in format **&quot;{word} = {reversed word}&quot;**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| helLoSoftunibottleend | helLo = oLlehSoftuni = inutfoSbottle = elttob |
| DogcaTchAirend | Dog = goDcaT = TacchAir = riAhc |

### Solution

Use while loop and read strings until you receive &quot;end&quot;.

Reverse the string with for loop. Start from the last index and append each symbol to the new string.

Print the reversed string in the specified format.
