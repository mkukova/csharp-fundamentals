1. 1.Data Types

Write a program that, depending on the first line of the input, reads an  **int** ,  **double**  or  **string**.

- If the data type is **int** , multiply the number by 2.
- If the data type is **real** , multiply the number by 1.5 and format it to the second decimal point.
- If the data type is **string** , surround the input with &quot;$&quot;.

Print the result on the console.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| int5 | 10 |
| real2 | 3.00 |
| stringhello | $hello$ |

### Hint

Try to solve the problem using only one method with different overloads.
