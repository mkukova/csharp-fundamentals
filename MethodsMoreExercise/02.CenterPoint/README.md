You are given the coordinates of two points on a [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) - X1, Y1, X2 and Y2. **Create a method** that prints the point that is closest to the center of the coordinate system (0, 0) in the format (X, Y). If the points are on a same distance from the center, print only the first one.
