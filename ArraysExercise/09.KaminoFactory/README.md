1. 9.\*Kamino Factory

The clone factory in Kamino got another order to clone troops. But this time you are tasked to find **the best DNA** sequence to use in the production.

You will receive the **DNA length** and until you receive the command **&quot;Clone them!&quot;** you will be receiving a **DNA sequences of ones and zeroes, split by &quot;!&quot;**** (one or several).**

You should select the sequence with the **longest subsequence of ones**. If there are several sequences with **same length of**** subsequence of ones **, print the one with the** leftmost ****starting index** , if there are several sequences with same **length and starting index** , select the sequence with the **greater sum** of its elements.

After you receive the last command **&quot;Clone them!&quot;** you should print the collected information in the following format:

&quot;Best DNA sample {bestSequenceIndex} with sum: {bestSequenceSum}.&quot;

&quot;{DNA sequence, joined by space}&quot;

### Input / Constraints

- The **first line** holds the **length** of the **sequences** – **integer in range [1…100];**
- On the next lines until you receive **&quot;Clone them!&quot;** you will be receiving sequences (at least one) of ones and zeroes, **split by &quot;!&quot;** (one or several).

###  Output

The output should be printed on the console and consists of two lines in the following format:

&quot;Best DNA sample {bestSequenceIndex} with sum: {bestSequenceSum}.&quot;

&quot;{DNA sequence, joined by space}&quot;

###  Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 51!0! **1!1**!00! **1!1**!0!0Clone them! | Best DNA sample 2 with sum: 2.0 1 1 0 0 | We receive 2 sequences with **same length**** of subsequence of ones **, but the second is printed, because its subsequence starts at** index[1].** |
| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |
| 4 **1!1**!0! **1** 1!0!0!1 **1!1**!0!0Clone them! | Best DNA sample 1 with sum: 3.1 1 0 1 | We receive 3 sequences. Both 1 and 3 **have same length** of subsequence of ones -\&gt; 2, **and both start from index[0]**, but the first is printed, because its **sum is greater.** |
