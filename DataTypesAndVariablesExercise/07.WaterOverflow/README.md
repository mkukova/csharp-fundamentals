# 7.Water Overflow

You have a **water**** tank **with capacity of** 255 liters **. On the next** n **lines, you will receive** liters of water **, which you have to** pour **in your** tank **. If the** capacity **is** not enough **, print &quot;** Insufficient capacity! **&quot; and** continue reading **the next line. On the last line, print the** liters **in the** tank**.

### Input

The **input** will be on two lines:

- On the **first**** line **, you will receive** n **– the number of** lines **, which will** follow**
- On the next **n lines** – you receive **quantities** of water, which you have to **pour** in the **tank**

### Output

Every time you do not have **enough**** capacity **in the tank to pour the given liters,** print**:

Insufficient capacity!

On the last line, **print** only the **liters** in the **tank**.

### Constraints

- **n** will be in the interval **[1…20]**
- **liters** will be in the interval **[1…1000]**
