1. 4.\*Star Enigma

The war is in its peak, but you, young Padawan, can turn the tides with your programming skills. You are tasked to create a program to **decrypt** the messages of The Order and prevent the death of hundreds of lives.

You will receive several messages, which are **encrypted** using the legendary star enigma. You should **decrypt the messages** , following these rules:

To properly decrypt a message, you should **count all the letters**** [s, t, a, r] **–** case insensitive **and** remove **the count from the** current ASCII value of each symbol** of the encrypted message.

After decryption:

Each message should have a **planet name, population, attack type (&#39;A&#39;, as attack or &#39;D&#39;, as destruction) and soldier count.**

The planet name **starts after****&#39;@&#39; **and contains** only letters from the Latin alphabet**.

The planet population **starts after &#39;:&#39;** and is an **Integer** ;

The attack type may be **&quot;A&quot;(attack) or &quot;D&quot;(destruction)** and must be **surrounded by &quot;!&quot;** (exclamation mark).

The **soldier count** starts after **&quot;-\&gt;&quot;** and should be an Integer.

The order in the message should be: **planet name -\&gt; planet population -\&gt; attack type -\&gt; soldier count.** Each part can be separated from the others by **any character except: &#39;@&#39;, &#39;-&#39;, &#39;!&#39;, &#39;:&#39; and &#39;\&gt;&#39;.**

### Input / Constraints

- The **first line**** holds n **– the number of** messages **–** integer in range [1…100];**
- On the next **n** lines, you will be receiving encrypted messages.

### Output

After decrypting all messages, you should print the decrypted information in the following format:

First print the attacked planets, then the destroyed planets.
**&quot;Attacked planets: {attackedPlanetsCount}&quot;
&quot;-\&gt; {planetName}&quot;
&quot;Destroyed planets: {destroyedPlanetsCount}&quot;
&quot;-\&gt; {planetName}&quot;**

The planets should be **ordered by name**** alphabetically.**

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |

After decrypting all messages we print each planet according the format given. |
