1. 1.Messaging

You will be given a **list of numbers** and a **string**. For each element of the list you have to **calculate the sum of its digits** and take the **element, corresponding to that index from the text**. If the index is **greater than the length of the text** , start counting **from the beginning** (so that you always have a valid index). After **you get**  **that**** element **from the text, youmust** remove the character** you have taken from it (so for the next index, the text will be with one character less).
