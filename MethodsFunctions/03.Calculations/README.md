# I.Declaring and Invoking Methods


1. 3.Calculations

Write a program that receives a string on the first line (add, multiply, subtract, divide) and on the next two lines receives two numbers. Create four methods (for each calculation) and invoke the right one depending on the command. The method should also print the result (needs to be void)

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| subtract54 | 1 |
| divide84 | 2 |

### Hints

1. Read the command on the first line and the two numbers, and then make an if/switch statement for each type of calculation

1. Then create the four methods and print the result
