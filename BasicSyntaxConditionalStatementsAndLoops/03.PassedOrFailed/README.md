# 1.Lab: Intro and Basic Syntax


1. 3.Passed or Failed

Modify the above program, so it will print &quot; **Failed**!&quot; if the grade is **lower than 3.00**.

### Input

The **input** comes as a single double number.

### Output

The **output** is either &quot; **Passed**!&quot; if the grade is **more than 2.99** , otherwise you should print &quot; **Failed**!&quot;.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.32 | Passed! |   | 2.36 | Failed! |

### Solution

Again, we need to take **floating-point** number from the console. After that print in the **else** statement the appropriate message.
