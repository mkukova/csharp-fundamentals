1. 1.Advertisement Message

Write a program that **generates random fake advertisement message** to advertise a product. The messages must consist of 4 parts: **phrase** + **event** + **author** + **city**. Use the following predefined parts:

- **Phrases** – {&quot;Excellent product.&quot;, &quot;Such a great product.&quot;, &quot;I always use that product.&quot;, &quot;Best product of its category.&quot;, &quot;Exceptional product.&quot;, &quot;I can&#39;t live without this product.&quot;}
- **Events** – {&quot;Now I feel good.&quot;, &quot;I have succeeded with this product.&quot;, &quot;Makes miracles. I am happy of the results!&quot;, &quot;I cannot believe but now I feel awesome.&quot;, &quot;Try it yourself, I am very satisfied.&quot;, &quot;I feel great!&quot;}
- **Authors** – {&quot;Diana&quot;, &quot;Petya&quot;, &quot;Stella&quot;, &quot;Elena&quot;, &quot;Katya&quot;, &quot;Iva&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Eva&quot;}
- **Cities** – {&quot;Burgas&quot;, &quot;Sofia&quot;, &quot;Plovdiv&quot;, &quot;Varna&quot;, &quot;Ruse&quot;}

The format of the output message is the following: **{phrase} {event} {author} – {city}**.

You will receive the **number of messages** to be generated. Print each random message at a separate line.
