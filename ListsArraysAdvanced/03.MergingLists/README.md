1. 3.Merging Lists

You are going to receive two lists with numbers. Create a result list, which contains the numbers from both of the lists. The **first**** element **should be** from the first list **, the** second **from the** second list **and so on. If the length of the two lists** are not equal **, just** add **the** remaining ****elements** at the **end** of the list.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| **3 5 2 43 12 3 54 10 23**** 76 5 34 2 4 12 **|** 3 ****76**** 5 ****5**** 2 ****34**** 43 ****2**** 12 ****4**** 3 ****12**** 54 ****10**** 23** |
| **76 5 34 2 4 12**** 3 5 2 43 12 3 54 10 23 **|** 76 ****3** 5 **5**** 34 ****2**** 2 ****43**** 4 ****12**** 12 ****3**** 54 10 23** |

### Hint

- Read the two lists
- Create a result list
- Start looping through them until you reach the end of the smallest one
- Finally add the remaining elements (if there are any) to the end of the list
