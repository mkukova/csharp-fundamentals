1. 4.Centuries to Minutes

Write program to enter an integer number of **centuries** and convert it to **years** , **days** , **hours** and **minutes**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 centuries = 100 years = 36524 days = 876576 hours = 52594560 minutes |
| 5 | 5 centuries = 500 years = 182621 days = 4382904 hours = 262974240 minutes |

### Hints

- Use appropriate data type to fit the result after each data conversion.
- Assume that a year has 2422 days at average ([the Tropical year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year)).
